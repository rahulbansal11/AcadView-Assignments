The cause of Parkinson's disease is generally unknown, but believed to 
involve both genetic and environmental factors.Those with a family member 
affected are more likely to get the disease themselves.There is also an 
increased risk in people exposed to certain pesticides and among those
who have had prior head injuries, while there is a reduced risk in tobacco 
smokers and those who drink coffee or tea.The motor symptoms of the disease 
result from the death of cells in the substantia nigra, a region of the midbrain.
This results in not enough dopamine in these areas.The reason for this cell death
is poorly understood, but involves the build-up of proteins into Lewy bodies 
in the neurons.
